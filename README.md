# Credit Risk Prediction Reassessed

**Overview:**  
This repository contains the final materials for a group research project for the Introduction to Machine Learning in Finance at UCL, Computational Finance MSc. It critically re-assesses credit risk prediction using advanced machine learning techniques. We revisited a published article on the subject, identified key methodological shortcomings—such as improper normalization and oversampling practices—and developed a more robust framework for predicting credit risk. Our work integrates state-of-the-art models (including XGBoost, SVM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons) with thorough hyperparameter tuning and evaluation methodologies.

**Project Components:**  
- **Final Code Notebook:** A complete Jupyter Notebook that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.  
- **Final Written Report:** A detailed report documenting our methodology, analysis, and critical evaluation of the published article, along with our enhancements and findings.  
- **Report Instructions:** The guidelines and instructions that framed this project.

**Key Achievements:**  
- Developed a robust data preprocessing pipeline that avoids data leakage that occurred in the reference article.
- Critically re-assessed a published credit risk prediction methodology, exposing unrealistic performance metrics and oversampling practices in the original work.
- Implemented and finely tuned multiple machine learning models, establishing a realistic and credible performance benchmark for credit risk prediction.
- Employed a comprehensive evaluation framework using multiple performance metrics and visualizations to illustrate model strengths and limitations.

**Usage:**  
To review the project, open the final code notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code, and refer to the final written report for detailed explanations and insights. The code is well documented for ease of understanding and further development.
